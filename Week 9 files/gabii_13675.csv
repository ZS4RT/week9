GPR,2010,B,,63.0326,63.3465,1158,Anthropic,"Near centre, at southern edge of Area B room.",Roughly rectangular deposit forming surface inside room; extends over preserved area of floor at north and over wall at west.,Finds listed in description: 130 chunk of bronze; 140 small bronze fragment; 146 bone die (broken); 150 small bronze coin.,"Transcribed from context sheet 104-13675 (SU 1158). Unit defined as
gravel and soil covering floor and walls of a smaller room, probably a
post-abandonment layer. Elevations are in metres (SI units).
Inclusions recorded on the form include pottery and tiles, nails, slag
and brick, various geological inclusions (sand, pebbles, gravel), and
organic inclusions (charcoal, animal bones, human bones). An olla (SU
1067) was removed from this SU on 09.07.2010 for potential residue
analysis; there was no obvious cut around 1067, so it is interpreted
as an inclusion within SU 1158 rather than its own cut."
